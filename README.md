## Welcome to Harvest!
Harvest is a beginner-friendly hackathon geared toward middle and high school students in the New England area, as a part of Hack Club‚Äôs Days of Service initiative to bring access to computer science education and a supportive hacking environment to groups that might not otherwise have access. We were all stoked to be able to organize this together and share our love of hacking with attendees, and hopefully encourage some of them to dive even deeper down the rabbit hole. Ultimately, all the time and work we put into building Harvest was all because we have all had the opportunity to learn and create in a supportive community here at Hack Club, and we want everyone to have that chance.

## Harvest Schedule
Hackathon schedules are quite typical, but we decided it would be a good idea to incorporate halloween-themed workshops and activities throughout the day! We also encouraged hackathon attendees to dress up to become in Halloween spirit, and many did not disappoint!

Our schedule consisted of ice breakers and a semi-official opening ceremony, along with beginner-friendly workshops throughout the day. We also alloted time aside for students to put their all-in to their projects, and many came up with extremely creative projects during the pitch presentations! For many, it was their first time writing lines of code, and this hackathon gave them the opportunity to turn their designs into fully-fledged projects.

## üöÄ Networking Dinner PCB Cards  
For this hackathon we wanted to tackle the problem of "networking acrobatics," the balancing act of trying to network while juggling food or other belongings in your hands. To solve this phenomenon we decided to create PCB buisness cards using Hackclub's really cool project-- [OnBoard](https://hackclub.com/onboard/)! 

We designed them with the Harvest fall theme in mind, turning regular buisness cards into electric mini pumpkins, and checked all the wiring. Because of time contraints, we had to order them unassembled, and the day before the networking dinner we sautered them at HQ!

But where will scanning these pumpkins take you? We set up an Airtable with names, profile pictures, and contact links of all the dinner guests. Taking it a step further, we built a website with the Airtable so that the information on it would be seamlessly incorporated on the website. This would also change the details depending on the name of the guest in the url. We used the NFC Tools app to connect each PCB to a different guest and labeled the personalized one. 

At the dinner, instead of losing time getting contact information, we were able to gain time connecting with a fascinating group of accomplished women. It was also a fun interactive experience and a great conversation starter! So, no more phone gymnastics--just a quick scan for smooth networking and more enjoyable experiences.

# Our Approach to Workshops

We wanted to ensure that our workshops would be unique yet simultaneously helpful for both begineers and intermediate coders. We decided to host two main beginner-friendly workshops, such as the Sprig and the Web Development workshops. We held these in the  main room instead of hosting separate hackathon rooms since there was an influx of interest in these workshops! By the end of the day, many had incorporated the workshop knowledge they'd learned into their projects, which was a beautiful sight to see.
